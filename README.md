## ASP.NET MVC with Twitter Bootstrap - Responsive demo

This demo page shows how to use [UI for ASP.NET MVC](https://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc) alongside [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

The relevant Kendo UI demo is available in [this repository](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-bootstrap-demo).

The grid layout and responsive CSS is provided by Bootstrap, and widgets are provided by Kendo UI. To see the responsive features, you can resize the page or customize it using the pickers on top.

To run the application locally install the latest version of **Telerik.UI.for.AspNet.MVC5** NuGet package through the Package Manager Console or Package Manager Dialog as described in this [help article](https://docs.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/getting-started/nuget-install#install-nuget-packages) and you are ready to go.
